# Predictors of Sclerosis Disease


This project aims to analyze and identify the factors that predict the progression of Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) to Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The study is based on a dataset collected from Mexican patients at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City between 2006 and 2010. Through this analysis, we hope to support early diagnosis and improve treatment strategies for MS patients.

## Definitions of Key Terms

**BAEP**: Brainstem auditory evoked potentials, used to assess auditory nerve pathways.

**VEP**: Visual evoked potential, measures damage to visual pathways.

**Oligoclonal Bands**: Immunoglobulins present in cerebrospinal fluid, a marker for MS.

**SSEP**: Somatosensory evoked potentials, used to evaluate nerve responses in limbs.

**EDSS**: Expanded Disability Status Scale, measures the severity of MS.
