# ðŸ§  Predictors of Sclerosis Disease

This project focuses on identifying the **key predictors** for the progression of **Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS)** to **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** using clinical and imaging data. The dataset is derived from patients at the **National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery**, Mexico City (2006â€“2010).

> ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Enable early MS diagnosis and support more effective treatment strategies through data-driven insights.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Goals

- Apply feature selection to find high-impact predictors of MS progression
- Use classification models (like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Analyze model performance using metrics: **Accuracy**, **ROC AUC**, **Confusion Matrix**
- Identify clinical features that could guide **early diagnosis and intervention**

## ðŸ’¡ Future Scope

- Integrate neuroimaging features for deeper analysis
- Use explainable AI (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to interpret model decisions
- Extend study to multi-center, diverse datasets
